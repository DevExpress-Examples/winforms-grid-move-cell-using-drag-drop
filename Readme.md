# WinForms Data Grid - Move cell contents using drag and drop (Microsoft Excel-inspired behavior)

This example handles `MouseDown`, `MouseMove`, and `MouseUp` events to allow users to move cell values using drag and drop:

* Select a data cell that you want to move.
* Point to the cell's bottom border.
* When the pointer becomes a multi-arrow move pointer, drag the cell to another location.
